NYISO DAY-AHEAD PRICE ANALYSIS: PANEL REGRESSION RESULTS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Data period: 2019 to 2025
Treatment date: May 1, 2022
Treatment group: Zone F (Capital)
Control groups: Zone C (Central), Zone NE (ISO-NE)
Volatile days definition: Prices > 2 standard deviations from long-term mean
Panel approach: Entity fixed effects with cluster-robust standard errors

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Basic treatment effect: 2.7292 (p = 0.000000)
   This suggests a statistically significant effect on prices after the policy change.

2. Additional effect during volatile days: 23.6775 (p = 0.015777)
   This indicates a statistically significant additional effect on prices
   during volatile days beyond the baseline effect.

3. Percentage effect on volatile days: 12.28% (p = 0.046137)
   The log-transformed model indicates a statistically significant
   12.28% change in prices during volatile days after the policy change.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------
This analysis uses a panel data approach implemented through OLS with the following features:
- Entity fixed effects included as zone dummies
- Cluster-robust standard errors at the zone level
- Year controls in selected models
- Triple interaction terms to isolate volatility effects

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------
The panel data analysis provides evidence that the May 2022 policy change
led to a significant increase in electricity prices in the treatment zone
compared to control zones, even after accounting for zone-specific fixed effects.

Most notably, the analysis reveals a substantially larger effect during
volatile days, suggesting the policy had its greatest impact during periods
of market stress when prices deviated significantly from their long-term averages.
